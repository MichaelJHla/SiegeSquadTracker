# Siege Squad Stats
### Introduction
This web application is designed as a companion app for the popular video game Rainbow 6 Siege. Utilizing this web application, players will be able to create, organize, and track their group or squad. The web application currently contains functionality for teams to manage their users, map bans, operator bans, and site statistics.

### Map Bans
The map bans section of the web application allows the user to develop their own person list of maps they prefer to play on. Once their list is created, a master list for the squad is created which organizes all members' bans lists into a single list. This makes the process of deciding which map to ban a lot easier since maps are ranked in order of overall popularity.

### Operator Bans
The operator bans section saves a master list for the entire squad. Any member of the squad can change this list. This list stores the operators that are preferred bans for a given map. The user selects a map from a dropdown, and the operator bans are listed for the given map. The user is then presented an option to alter the bans.

### Site Stats
The site stats section of the page allows users to view the user-submitted stats for any site and map in the game. Once a map is selected, a list of sites is displayed which lets the user view and submit stats for the given site.
